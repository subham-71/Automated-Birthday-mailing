Input your email and password in the required field                                                                         

Create a birthday.csv file containing birthdays of people format: -name,email,year,month,day

Also create a folder for storing different letter templates. I had created here three templates from which randomly one template is chosen while mailing.

Also make sure to turn on access to less secured apps to your email account or use an app password so as to send the mail.
